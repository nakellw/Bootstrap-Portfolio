                    Hello, my name is Nakell Williams. I am from Greenville, South Carolina. I was raised in a small part of Greenville called
                    Foutain Inn, where I spend majority of my life. During my time growing up, I attended Hillcrest High
                    School where I played varsity fooball, track, and basketball while maintaining a 3.700 GPA. After graduation,
                    I decided to continue my education at the University of South Carolina.
                </p>
            </div>
            </div>
                <p>
                    During my time at the University of South Carolina, I majored in Integrated Information Technology (iIT). I spend four years
                    at the University of South Carolina, while graduating with a 3.78 GPA and pledging the great fraternity
                    on the planet, Kappa Alpha Psi. I also recieved an job offer for a IT rotation program for 18 months
                    at Lowe's corporate office, which i accepted. Within Lowe's I have had 2 role , business analyst and
                    technical analyst both within the digital department. I have been promoted two within two years, and
                    learned alot. I plan on continuing this journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With my career in Information Technology, my future goal is to be a Senior level technical analyst/developer or architect
                    within a major company. With my experience with the business side of IT and the skills and assets I will
                    gain from this class. I believe I would be put in a great position with my prior experience to achieve
                    my goals.
